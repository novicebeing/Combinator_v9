VIPA Workspace TODO List:
-------------------------

- Allow for using acquired spectrum to calibrate

- Allow for setting of the approximate calibration function

- remove yavg, tavg from spectraobject as they are no longer necessary

- FFT x axis seems to be off by a factor of 2

- Add "new figure" capabilities

- Add x and y labels to fits plots

- Add "make spectra without reference"

- Remove bg substraction when averaging spectra

- Add real-time fitting of spectra

Cosmetic / Ease of use

- Add fixed with left sidebar

- Add normalization option in group plots

- Add x and y labels to fits plots

- Make averaging bar chart an object

- Add instrument phase option

- Add inspect option on objects

DOCO Acquire Procedure:
----------------------

1. Acquire a cavity transmission image, use to fit fringes

2. Acquire a OD+CO spectrum, use to fit D2O lines

3. Acquire other data
